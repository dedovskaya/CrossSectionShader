**Cross Section Shader** shader facilitates the visualization of an object's cross-section by incorporating a clipping plane. This shader is specifically designed to provide a detailed and dynamic representation of the internal structure of an object.

The project includes a shader graph and corresponding material. Unity version is 2021.3.20f1. To run the demo install **TextMeshPro** and its additional files and set **Universal Rendering Pipeline** as your rendering pipeline. The **ClippingPlane** script is attached to a plane object, dynamically modifying the material at runtime to synchronize with the position and rotation of the plane.
